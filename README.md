# MonsterHunterPortable3rdHDRemake
Repo for a texture upscaling project for PSP's Monster Hunter Portable 3rd HD

The goal of this project is to increase the quality of textures from the Monster Hunter Portable 3rd HD game, while maintaining true to the original look and feel of the game.

Optional extras will be included such as variations of the standard maps. e.g. Maps with a cell shaded style or maps indicating resource locations.

Requirements:
- PPSSPP 1.3 or later (PPSSPP with texture replacement ability)
- Playable Monster Hunter Portable 3rd HD (NPJB40001)
- Optional? V5.0 translation patch

Note, the textures were made using the V5.0 Translation patch applied. Your mileage may vary if you do not apply said patch before trying to run these textures.

How to install:
- Enable Settings   ->  Tools   ->  Developer Options   ->  Replace Textures
- Copy the Textures folder from this repo in to your memstick/PSP directory
- Run the game and enjoy!
